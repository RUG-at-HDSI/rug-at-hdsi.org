#### Join us on {{ page.event_date }} at {{ page.time }}!

Join the R User Group at the Harvard Data Science Initiative and 
Data and Donuts for an afternoon of R lightning talks! Give a lightning talk
and be entered to win a Raspberry Pi. Join the event as an attendee and be
entered to win a book on enhancing
your R skills.


<b>What is a lightning talk?</b>

A lightning talk is a short, fast-paced talk about a topic you'd like to share but might not make sense as a longer, formal presentation. We're not looking for your most polished research -- just something that gets you excited about R! The goal is to spark a conversation and increase awareness among your fellow useRs.

Lightning talk ideas include a short tutorial on a feature in R you find particularly exciting or useful,different ways of approaching a problem you've encountered in your code, a problem you're currently struggling with in R, or a fun application of R.

For this event, we're especially interested in applications of R to economics, political science, econometrics, public policy, health policy, education and related fields. We'd love to see how you're using R in humanities or STEM, but we'd especially love to highlight work being done at the Kennedy School, Education School, GSAS, or School of Public Health. Some topics that would be particularly relevant to our group of regular attendees include survey weighting or survey methodologies, panel data, Census data, mapping, and spatial/temporal data analysis.

<b>How can I give a lightning talk?</b>

[Submit your lightning talk idea through this form](https://forms.gle/StxHhWfLqqaAPG9VA) by Monday, November 11.

All lightning talks should be 5-8 minutes. We strongly encourage the use of slides, but they should support your talk instead of being the focus. Think: A cool plot or critical code chunk you'd like to highlight. We also welcome speakers giving live R demos, but slides should include static code for distribution after the event.

<b>How can I attend the event even if I don't want to give a lightning talk?</b>

All are welcome to join this event in person or on Zoom! Register to receive a link to join via Zoom. In-person attendees can join us on the HKS campus in Rubenstein 414 (take the elevator up from the main Wexner entrance and go all the way down the hall). Those without an HUID may enter via the Wexner security desk after showing a photo ID.

<b>What is Data + Donuts?</b>

Led by HKS Library & Research Services, Data + Donuts features researchers and practitioners speaking about how they use data in their work, and on issues of data and society. Data + Donuts welcomes those from the HKS community and beyond to share knowledge, discussion, and donuts.
