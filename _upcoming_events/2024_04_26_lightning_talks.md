What is a lightning talk? 

A lightning talk is a short, fast paced talk about a topic you’d like to share, but might not be fit for a longer, formal presentation. We’re not looking for your most polished research, but rather something that gets you excited about R! Some ideas include: a short tutorial on a feature in R that you find particularly exciting or useful, different ways of approaching a problem you’ve encountered in your code, discussing a problem you’re currently struggling with in R, or even just a fun application of R. The goal of a lightning talk is to spark a conversation about your topic and increase awareness among your fellow useRs! 

We ask that each lightning talk be limited to 5-8 minutes. The use of slides is strongly encouraged, but should be used sparingly to support the topic, rather than the focus of the lightning talk – think:  a cool plot that supports your topic or a critical code chunk that you’d like to highlight. We also welcome our speakers to do a live demo in R if that is their preferred format, but will request that slides with static code are provided prior to the event in case of technology failures and for distribution after the event. **All slides will be requested to be submitted to <datascience_rug@harvard.edu> by 11:59 PM EST on Wednesday, April 24th, 2024 (Two days in advance).**
