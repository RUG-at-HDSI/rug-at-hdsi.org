blurb: |
    Join us to learn about how to use the git software to version control your code
    and much more.  Version control software, like git, is like track changes for
    your code, but even more powerful!  Git enables you not just to track the
    iterations of your codebase, but to easily collaborate with others (without
    emailing zip files back and forth!), to go back in time to check how your code
    used to look, to safely test out new ideas, and much more.  GitHub is an online
    service that provides free git services so you can use it to backup your git
    repositories, share them with others â€“ and even build out websites and a
    professional portfolio of your software and programming work. GitHub is one of
    the most relevant technologies for any programmer, so we welcome you to join us
    to learn how you can leverage git and GitHub for your R programming adventures!
