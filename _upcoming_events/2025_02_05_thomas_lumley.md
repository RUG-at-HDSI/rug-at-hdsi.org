blurb: |
    The survey package for R was developed to allow routine statistical
    analysis to account for complex sampling designs, and to provide a platform
    for new research.  I will explain how the package represents survey designs
    and the importance of influence functions in thinking about and
    implementing survey analyses generically.  I will also talk about some of
    the analyses the package supports and some it does not support.  There will
    be extended time for discussion: bring your questions.
