blurb: |
  Christian and Nicole will provide an introduction to functional programming in R.  In case you haven't heard of functional programming before, it's a powerful programming technique that allows programmers to pass functions as arguments and write code that applies functions repeatedly on the programmer's behalf.  This means we can do some quite nifty things like succinctly applying one function to a whole list of objects, creating lists of functions, or passing functions as variables to other functions.  Functional programming is a great skill for any R programmer to have in their back-pocket and can take your programming to the next level, increasing your productivity and making it easier for you to solve complex problems.
