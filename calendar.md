The inaugural meeting of the R User Group (RUG) will be on June 10th at 5 p.m..
RUG seeks to connect users of the statistical programming language R in the
greater Harvard community. We look forward to welcoming all those interested in
R, from beginners to experts! We will be presenting a short presentation of
some unique applications of R and discussing what members would like to see in
the group.
