Join us for an introductory session on using R and RStudio to analyze data and create data visualizations.

We'll be going over:
  - Using RStudio
  - Basics of R Programming
  - Making Plots
  - Data manipulation and visualization with an example CSV dataset (attached)

The example CSV dataset includes a collection of women-owned businesses in the Boston area and is available from the data.boston.gov website (https://data.boston.gov/dataset/women-owned-businesses).

We're recommending that you have R and RStudio installed in advance of today's talk so that you can follow along if you think that would be helpful to you.

If you'd like to get a head-start in advance of today's talk, try 
installing the following packages in R or RStudio:

~~~ r
install.packages("ggplot2")
