We watched 
a pre-recorded (available on YouTube:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvgzIx5mDNM>) TidyTuesday data
analysis video walkthrough by Julia Silge using principal
components analysis on hip hop lyrics.  We had some additional
time for Q&A afterwards in which we talked about PCA as well as
what we can do to avoid learning problematic normalized
behaviors in programming.
