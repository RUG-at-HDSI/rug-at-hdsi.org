blurb: |
    It's easy to think that R users do not need HTML & CSS. But these web languages are everywhere, even in R. Knowing just a bit of HTML & CSS can unlock the full potential of popular R tools like {gt}, {ggtext}, {shiny}, and Quarto. <br><br>
    This talk is split into two parts. First, I will motivate learning HTML & CSS for R users through various examples. Second, I will show you the necessary basics to get you started on your HTML & CSS journey.
