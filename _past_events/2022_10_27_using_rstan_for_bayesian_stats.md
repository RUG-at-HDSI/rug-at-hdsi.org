blurb: |
  Join us to learn about how you can use RStan to perform Bayesian statistics
  in R! This talk will provide an introduction to what Bayesian statistics and
  RStan are and how you can get started using them.  Fayette Klaassen will
  introduce how to write a Stan program and describe the workflow using Stan as
  well as go over some example Stan models. Finally, we'll go over some common
  troubleshooting tips and examples in practice.

## Bio 

Fayette Klaassen is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Global
Health and Population at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where
she works on Bayesian statistical models to predict COVID-19 infections.

She received her PhD in Methodology and Statistics from Utrecht University in 2020. 
In her doctoral research she focused on evaluating the efficiency of
Bayesian hypothesis testing using inequality constraints. She is interested in
developing and applying methods for evidence synthesis of replications or
multiple data sources.
