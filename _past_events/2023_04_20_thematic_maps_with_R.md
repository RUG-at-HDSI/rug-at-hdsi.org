blurb: |
   The R software has a rich, dynamic and mature spatial ecosystem. Several R
   packages allow to leverage the power of major FOSS libraries (like GDAL,
   GEOS or PROJ) for spatial data management and {mapsf} takes advantage of
   this ecosystem to create thematic maps. It helps designing various
   cartographic representations and offers several functions to display layout
   elements improving the graphic presentation of maps.

   In this talk, we will present the thematic cartography package {mapsf} and a
   set of smaller packages dedicated to more specific map types. Spatial
   representations created with R are fully reproducible and we argue that they
   can reach the same visual quality level as those built with a classical mapping
   or GIS software.
