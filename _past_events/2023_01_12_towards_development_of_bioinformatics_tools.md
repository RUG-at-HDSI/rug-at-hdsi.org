    Join us as Chanin describes the thought process that goes behind the
    compilation and curation of bioactivity datasets, building machine
    learning models and deploying it as a web app using Shiny in R.

## Bio 

Chanin Nantasenamat, PhD works full-time as a Senior Developer Advocate for
Streamlit Open Source at Snowflake Inc. where he creates educational contents
on how to use Streamlit to build interactive data apps. He is also a content
creator creating free data science and bioinformatics tutorial videos on his
YouTube channel Data Professor (<https://youtube.com/dataprofessor>).
Previously, he was in academia for 15 years where he was an Associate Professor
of Bioinformatics and Head, Center of Data Mining and Biomedical Informatics at
Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University. He received his BSc in
Biological Science from Mahidol University International College in 2002 and
his PhD in Medical Technology from Mahidol University in 2006. His research
interests (now his hobby) is at the interface of biology, chemistry and
computer science encompassing interdisciplinary areas such as bioinformatics,
cheminformatics, chemogenomics and quantitative structure-activity relationship
(QSAR) proteochemometrics (PCM) for exploring the underlying origins of protein
function and its modulation (i.e. inhibition or activation). Such understanding
holds great implication for drug discovery, particularly in the discovery of
novel bioactive compounds with therapeutic activity. He also builds
bioinformatics tools in Python and R to make bioinformatics and machine
learning models accessible to all.
