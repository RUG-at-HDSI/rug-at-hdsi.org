blurb: |
  The {learnr} package makes it easy to turn any <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a> document into an interactive tutorial. Tutorials consist of content along with interactive components for checking and reinforcing understanding. Tutorials automatically preserve work done within them, so if a user works on a few exercises or questions and returns to the tutorial later they can pick up right where they left off. Learn more about {learnr} <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/">here</a>.
