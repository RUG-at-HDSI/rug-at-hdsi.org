blurb: |
  {plumber} is an R package that allows users to create web APIs by
  decorating R functions using {roxygen2}-like comments. In this
  meetup, we will go over the basics of an API, a server, and how
  plumber can help you create a web-based API using R so that you
  can share your data/research/visualizations/{htmlwidgets} to the
  world.
