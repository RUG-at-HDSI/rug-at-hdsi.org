blurb: |
  R is great for scientific reproducibility, but as work scales from individual
  to teams, organizations, and collaborations across teams, time, and space, R
  scripts and git repositories are no longer sufficient to capture project
  complexity.  Reproducibility has to work for field, lab, analytical, and
  policy groups, and address challenges such as high-performance computing,
  large data, data privacy and security, and the re-use of data and analyses
  across separate but related projects. I will present lessons learned at
  EcoHealth Alliance in making reproducible R-based projects work for
  collaborative and interdisciplinary science. I will showcase tools and
  approaches we have adopted and developed beyond standard best practices. I
  will discuss the team structure, onboarding and ongoing training we conduct
  to make R and reproducibility a core pillar of our research.

## Bio

Dr. Noam Ross is Principal Scientist for Computational Research at EcoHealth
Alliance, a global nonprofit working at the nexus of conservation and human
health. He also serves as Software Peer Review Lead at rOpenSci, a developer
collective building technical and social infrastructure for open science in the
R language.  Noam's biological work focuses on applied and theoretical
forecasting of zoonotic disease emergence, understanding disease circulation in
wildlife populations and in wildlife-human contact processes, and study design
for One Health research. His computational work includes building inclusiveness
and diversity in the scientific software ecosystem, review and validation of
scientific and statistical software, and reproducible computing environments.
He holds a PhD in Ecology from the University of California, Davis.
